# OpenWeatherMap

The application retrieves up-to-date weather information for the provided location and presents it to the user. It shows the present weather conditions, the city's name, and the existing weather situation at the specified place. Additionally, it showcases weather information tailored to the user's location by obtaining their current latitude and longitude for accurate data retrieval.

The data was fetched from the OpenWeathermap in JSON format and parsed into Swift models.

Due to the time constraints, unable to implement the weather forcast part in the requirement.
